> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The library is currently broken. If you pair two elements you get a [`403 Forbidden` error](https://github.com/sqdnoises/infinite-craft/issues/2). A fix for this is currently being made.

# Key Features:
- Stores elements in a neatly indented JSON file
- Starts with the four main elements: Water, Fire, Wind, Earth
- Uses [`neal.fun`](https://neal.fun/)'s [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) API to pair elements together
- Built-in ratelimiting handler
- Custom API support
- Asynchronous library
- Conveniently access discovered elements

# Examples
### Using `async with`
```py
import asyncio
from infinitecraft import InfiniteCraft

async def main():
    async with InfiniteCraft() as game: # automatically start session and end session on async with end
        print(f"Pairing elements: {game.discoveries[0]} and {game.discoveries[1]}")
        result = await game.pair(game.discoveries[0], game.discoveries[1]) # Pair Water and Fire
        print(f"Result: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Manually controlling
```py
import asyncio
from infinitecraft import InfiniteCraft

game = InfiniteCraft()

async def main():
    await game.start() # Start InfiniteCraft Session
    
    print(f"Pairing elements: {game.discoveries[0]} and {game.discoveries[1]}")
    result = await game.pair(game.discoveries[0], game.discoveries[1]) # Pair Water and Fire
    print(f"Result: {result}")

    await game.close() # Close InfiniteCraft Session

asyncio.run(main())
```

# Documentation üìö
Documentation is *coming soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è*

While the documentation is not ready, everything is documented well in the code with docstrings which you can see in an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

*You can also see the in-development documentation page [here](https://sqdnoises.gitbook.io/infinite-craft).*

# How does it work?
This library basically contacts the URL:
https://neal.fun/api/infinite-craft/pair?first=element+name&second=element+name \
Tricks it with some headers, and handles everything accordingly.

Everything is handled in a user-friendly manner and asynchronously, so it should be really easy to use it in your programs.

# To-do
- [x] ~~Release version 1.0.0 on PyPI~~
- [x] ~~Make a discord server for support~~ Join our community! https://discord.gg/FF2fSN2sJd
- [x] ~~Add a runnable and configurable CLI mock API server~~
- [x] ~~Make docs~~
- [ ] Fix [403 Forbidden Error](https://github.com/sqdnoises/infinite-craft/issues/2)
- [ ] Finish docs
- [ ] Make a playable Infinite Craft CLI game (interactive, probably)
