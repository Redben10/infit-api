# ðŸ“– Introduction

infinite-craft is an **API Wrapper** of [Neal's Infinite Craft game](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft) in **Python** for people to implement in their programs.

[**View `infinite-craft` on PyPI.**](https://pypi.org/project/infinite-craft/)

## Key Features

* Stores elements in a neatly indented JSON file
* Starts with the four main elements: Water, Fire, Wind, Earth
* Uses [`neal.fun`](https://neal.fun/)'s [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) API to pair elements together
* Built-in ratelimiting handler
* Custom API support
* Asynchronous library
* Conveniently access discovered elements

## How does it work?

This library basically contacts the URL:\
[https://neal.fun/api/infinite-craft/pair?first=element+name\&second=element+name](https://neal.fun/api/infinite-craft/pair?first=element+name\&second=element+name)\
Tricks it with some headers, and handles everything accordingly.

Everything is handled in a user-friendly manner and asynchronously, so it should be really easy to use it in your programs.
